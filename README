# Installation

Uuidm was tested with OCaml 3.10. uuidm.mli and uuidm.ml contain
everything, the code, the documentation and the license. You can just
copy them to your project directory or better, if you use ocamlbuild,
issue the following commands from the root directory of your project :

  > ln -s /path/to/uuidm-%%VERSION%%/src uuidm
  > echo "<uuidm> : include" >> _tags

The documentation is generated by ocamldoc from uuidm.mli. You can find
a generated version in the doc/ directory of the distribution.

If you have ocamlbuild, uuidm can be installed in the uuidm/ directory 
of `ocamlc -where` by typing :
 
  > ./build 
  > ./build install 

to install to a different location :

  > INSTALLDIR=/path/to/install/dir ./build install 

Test programs are provided in the test/ directory. They can be built
with :

  > ./build test.native
  > ./build perf.native
  > ./build uuid.native

Invoking them with -help will tell you more.
