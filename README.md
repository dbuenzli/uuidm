Uuidm â€” Universally unique identifiers (UUIDs) for OCaml
========================================================

Uuidm is an OCaml library implementing 128 bits universally unique
identifiers version 3, 5 (named based with MD5, SHA-1 hashing), 4
(random based), 7 (time and random based) and 8 (custom) according to
[RFC 9562].

Uuidm has no dependency. It is distributed under the ISC license.

## Installation

Uuidm can be installed with `opam`:

    opam install uuidm

If you don't use `opam` consult the [`opam`](opam) file for build
instructions.

## Documentation

The documentation can be consulted [online] or via `odig doc uuidm`.

Questions are welcome but better asked on the [OCaml forum][ocaml-forum]
than on the issue tracker.

## Sample programs

The [`uuidtrip`] tool generates UUIDs and outputs them on stdout.
