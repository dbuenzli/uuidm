(** Universally unique identifiers (UUIDs).  

    [Uuidm] implements 128 bits universally unique identifiers version
    3, 5 (name based with MD5, SHA-1 hashing) and 4 (random based)
    according to {{:http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4122.txt}RFC 4122}.

(** {1 UUIDs} *)

type t
(** The type for UUIDs. *)

type version = [ 
  | `V3 of t * string (** Name based with MD5 hashing *)
  | `V4 (** Random based *) 
  | `V5 of t * string (** Name based with SHA-1 hasing *) ]
(** The type for UUID versions and generation parameters. [`V3] and [`V5]
    specify a namespace and a name for the generation. [`V4] is random based 
    with a private state seeded with [Random.State.make_self_init], use 
    {!v4_gen} to specify your own seed. *)

val nil : t
(** [nil] is the nil UUID. *)

val ns_dns : t
(** [ns_dns] is the DNS namespace UUID. *)

val ns_url : t
(** [ns_url] is the URL namespace UUID. *)

val ns_oid : t
(** [ns_oid] is the ISO OID namespace UUID. *)

val ns_X500 : t
(** [ns_dn] is the X.500 DN namespace UUID. *)

val create : version -> t
(** [create version] is an UUID of the given [version]. *)

val v3 : t -> string -> t
(** [v3 ns n] is [create `V3 (ns, n)]. *) 

val v5 : t -> string -> t
(** [v5 ns n] is [create `V5 (ns, n)]. *)

val v4_gen : Random.State.t -> (unit -> t)
(** [v4 seed] is a function that generates random version 4 UUIDs with
    the given [seed]. *)

val compare : t -> t -> int
(** Total order on UUIDs. *)

val equal : t -> t -> bool
(** [equal u u'] is [true] iff [u] and [u'] are equal. *)

val of_bytes : ?pos:int -> string -> t option
(** [of_bytes pos s] is the UUID represented by the 16 bytes starting
    at [pos] in [s] ([pos] defaults to [0]).  Returns [None] if the
    string is not long enough. *)

val to_bytes : t -> string
(** [to_bytes u] is [u] as a 16 bytes long string. *)

(**/**)
val unsafe_to_bytes : t -> string
(**/**) 

val of_string : ?pos:int -> string -> t option
(** [of_string pos s] converts the substring of [s] starting at [pos]
    (defaults to [0]) of the form ["XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX"]
    where X is a lower or upper case hexadecimal number to an
    UUID. Returns [None] if a parse error occured.  *)

val to_string : ?upper:bool -> t -> string
(** [to_string u] is [u] as a string of the form
    ["XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX"] where X is
    a lower case hexadecimal number (or upper if [upper] is
    [true]). *)

val print : ?upper:bool -> Format.formatter -> t -> unit
(** See {!to_string}. *)
